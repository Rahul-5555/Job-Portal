//1. Controller

In a MERN stack project, the Controller folder is used in the backend to manage the logic for handling incoming requests, interacting with the database, and sending responses. The controller acts as a bridge between the routes and the database models, encapsulating the business logic so that routes remain clean and focused on routing tasks.

Why is the Controller Folder Structure Important?
Separation of Concerns:

By creating a controller, you separate the logic (like fetching data, handling business operations) from the routes. This makes the code more modular and maintainable.
If your app scales and you need to add more features or endpoints, having controllers allows you to update or debug code more easily.
Clean and Organized Code:

Instead of writing business logic directly in your routes, you keep your routing logic minimal and abstract the logic into controllers. This makes it easier to understand what each part of the code does.
Reusability:

With controllers, you can reuse functions across different routes. For example, if multiple routes need similar database operations, you can write that logic once in a controller and use it in various places.
Typical Flow in a MERN Stack:
Frontend: User interacts with a UI component in React (e.g., clicking a button).
Request: React sends an HTTP request (usually via axios or fetch) to the backend API route.
Route: The Express.js route matches the URL of the request and forwards the request to a specific controller function.
Controller: The controller function handles the request. It performs logic like validating data, interacting with the database, and then returns a response.
Database: The controller communicates with the MongoDB database via a model (using Mongoose).
Response: The controller sends back a response to the frontend (e.g., success message or requested data).
